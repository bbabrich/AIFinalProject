There was a young man from Racine
Who invented a fucking machine.
Concave or convex,
It served either sex,
But oh what a bitch to keep clean.

There once was a woman from Arden
Who was seen sucking a man in the garden
Her mother said, "Flo,
Where does it all go??
And she said, "Gulp, Beg your pardon?"

There once was a genie
With a ten foot weenie
Who showed it to the girl next door
She thought it was a snake
And hit it with a rake

there once was a woman whose kids
had given her hanging tits

now it's all wrong
soon they'll be where my belly button sits.

who fell a thousand feet
he lost all his money when he ran over a bunny
and now he's covered in sleet
My English teacher is Mrs O'Rourke
She is one who loves to talk

Liquid nitrogens not very nice
In fact it feels colder than ice.
Applied to the toe
It hurts, don't you know.
A treatment I wouldn't want twice!!

There was a young lady of Natchez
Who chanced to be born with two snatches,
And she often said, "Shit!
Why, I'd give either tit,
For a man with equipment that matches."

An ebony princess named D,
Took a job at that place, See Me Pee,
One night she got lit,
And on FAR CAM, she SHIT,
We each held our nose, naturally. 

A limerick usually is crude.
More than fifty percent are real lewd.
Some don't make much cents,
Even though you're not dense.
Just a whole lot of crap being spewed.


There once was a girl from Azores,
Whose pussy was covered in sores,
There wasn't a dog in the street,
That would eat the red meat,

A UNIX sales lady, Lenore,
Enjoys work, but she likes the beach more.
She found a good way
To combine work and play:
She sells C shells by the seashore.

The president's loud protestation,
On his fall to the interns temptation:
"This affair is still moral,
As long as it's oral.
Straight screwing I save for the nation." 

She would give a good wank
Like any good skank.
There once was an Imam in Kabul
who had nodules and warts on his tool
one could hear joyous grunts

A conflicted young priest from Southampton,
while believing all sin should be stamped on,
had been loving the strength
and the girth and the length
of the cock that his mouth had been clamped on.

A newspaper poet for Hearst
Deprived of his reason
By uncontrolled sneezing
Was by fan taz mall demons coerced
To write all of his limericks reversed.

who got caught whilst jerk in his gerk in.
His mother said “lurk in, quit jerk in your gerk in,
your gerkin’s for fur kin not jerk in
The bold and daring Adair
like to fuck on the stair

There once was a lady named dot,
Who lived off pig shit and snot.
When she couldn't get these,
She'd eat the green cheese,
That she scraped form the sides of her twat.

A narcissistic girl from Lasalle,
Put an ad on the net for a pal.
Her answers were few
Only offers to screw.
That sure didn't help her moral. 

There was an old fellow named Green, 
Who grew so abnormally lean, 
And flat, and compressed, 
That his back touched his chest, 
And sideways he couldn't be seen.

If vodka were water and I were a duck,
I'd swim to the bottom and never come up.
But water's not vodka and I'm not a duck,
So pass me a bottle and shut the fuck up.
Said a woman with open delight,

The lands of the sue are open, tis, 
To the hardy white settler who likes all things new; 
But what will he do 
When the frolic some sue 
Swoop down on him, scalp him and chop him in two?

A woman, her name was Mary,
I think her cunt quite scary.
For in there had been
a number of men
And if I’d known I’d been wary.
