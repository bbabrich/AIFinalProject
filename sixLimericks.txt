There once was a guy named Chuck Norris
he landed on the ground before us
first he kicked some fat guys
then flicked some bad flies
then he punched a Tyrannosaurus 

There was an old dame from Lahore
Who was horny, hungry and poor
For a dollar or two
She’d offer to screw
And say “Give me more, give me more, give me more!”

And she was bred instead 
There once was a man from the sticks
Who was born with two large dicks
After much negotiations
For double penetrations

A silly young fellow named Hyde, 
In a funeral procession was spied ; 
When asked, " Who is dead?" 
He giggled and said, 
I don't know ; I just came for the ride."

A girl who was called Sara Knight,
Filled both guys and girls with delight.
Regardless the gender,
They loved to rear end 'er,
And two at a time felt just right! 

There once was an anus named Jeever
Who's owner was a bible believer
He was exit only
Till his owner met Foley
And now he's become a reciever.
